# API Advanced Project

This project provides a Python function that interacts with the Reddit API to fetch the number of subscribers for a given subreddit. The function handles invalid subreddit cases gracefully by returning 0. It uses the `requests` library for making HTTP requests and follows best practices for handling API responses and errors.
